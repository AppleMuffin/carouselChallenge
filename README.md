carousel demo for OLIVER Agency

A multi-carousel app for OLIVER Agency's coding challenge.
There are 3 carousels, each holding 3 videos from TikTok. Each carousel has navigation buttons (previous and next), to cycle through. 
Each video can be paused/played with a click, and navigating to the next/previous video will stop the current one that was running.

Improvements to consider for v1.1:
//Currently 3 carousels can run 3 videos independently. I suppose this doesn't make much sense because who would want 3 videos playing at the same time? Could force it so only one video can play at any time.
//Could add a volume slider for each video.
//Accessibility sr-only/aria elements could be added
//Considered randomizing TikTok videos but their API doesn't seem to support it. Tried making my own algorithm that randomizes TikTok URLs which apparently used to work in the past (based on my googling) but it looks like TikTok stopped this.
